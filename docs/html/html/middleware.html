          <p>
          <a href="">Middleware</a> is common design pattern in frameworks of many kinds and is responsible
          for performing custom logic upon receiving a request and sending a response.
          Despite its ubiquity, there is little to no standardization of the
          middleware interface and therefore little to no reusability of
          components across different frameworks. In contrast, Pybiz
          middleware is reusable across any type of Pybiz application, whether an
          RPC service a or REST API.
          </p>
          <p>
          To illustrate the downside of non-standardization, imagine that you
          currently rely on a web framework to manage database
          transactions using middleware. Imagine now that the need arises to execute the
          same endpoint inside an <a href="">Celery</a> task or a
          command-line application where your web framework's middleware is not in
          play. At this point, you have no choice but to decouple transaction
          management from the middleware of your framework in order to
          manage transactions explicitly in external contexts.
          </p>

          <p>
          This is exactly the problem Pybiz middleware solves. Pybiz middleware is
          actually "meta-middleware" in the sense that it can be reused with absolutely no
          code change across different types of applications, like web apps,
          command-line apps, REPL sessions, or RPC services.
          </p>

          <h2>The Middleware Interface</h2>

          <p> To implement middleware, one need only override one or more methods
            on the <span class="inline-code">Middleware</span> base class. These
            methods are described in the doc strings below. In overview, they are
            as follows:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><span>pre_request</span> - before raw arguments are processed</li>
            <li><span>on_request</span> - after raw arguments are processed</li>
            <li><span>post_request</span> - after endpoint returns</li>
            <li><span>post_bad_request</span> - after endpoint raises an exception</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Using middleware in Pybiz applications is simple. You simply pass a
            list of middleware objects to the constructor or bootstrap method of
            an Application, as seen below. There is no functional difference
            between the two methods. It's up to you to determine which approach
            makes the most sense in your own system.
          </p>
          <h3>Passing Middleware Via Constuctor</h3>
          <pre class="prettyprint">
  app = Application(middleware=[MyMiddleware()])
          </pre>

          <h3>Passing Middleware Via Bootstrap</h3>
          <pre class="prettyprint">
  app = Application().bootstrap(middleware=[MyMiddleware()])
          </pre>
        </div>
      </div>

          <h2><a name="sharing">Sharing Middleware Between Applications</a></h2>
          <p>
            In some case, you might want to share middleware between multiple
            Application types. For example, you may want to execute an endpoint
            both within a Pybiz REPL for internal development purposes as well as
            in a web app through an HTTP server. When it comes to defining
            middleware for use in these applications, you have a couple options.
            The most explicit approach would consist of defining two separate
            middleware lists for each application, respectively, giving you something like this:
            </p>

            <pre class="prettyprint">
  repl = Repl(middleware=[MyMiddleware()])
  web = WebService(middleware=[MyMiddleware()])
            </pre>

            <p>
              Alternatively, for convenience, you may optionally override the
              app_types property on the Middleware base class, which returns a
              tuple of pybiz Application subclasses that recognize and bootstrap
              middleware instances. Here is the base property definition:

            <pre class="prettyprint">
  @property
  def app_types(self) -> Tuple[Type['Application']]:
      """
      Return a tuple of Application classes for which this middleware applies.
      """
      return (Application, )
            </pre>

            <p>This is useful for defining a single list of middleware that is
            shared across your Pybiz applications. For example, if you create
            Middleware that inspects HTTP headers upon each request, then outside
            the context of web apps, this middleware would break; therefore, you
            would want to disable it when running your application as, say, a
            command-line application.
            </p>

            <p>The following example code illustrates this:</p>

            <pre class="prettyprint">
  # define middleware that applies only to Application subclasses of HttpService
  class HttpHeadersMiddleware(Middleware):

      @property
      def app_types(self):
          return (HttpService, )

  # create a list of shared middleware
  middleware = [HttpHeadersMiddleware()]

  # intantiate applications with shared middleware
  repl = Repl(middleware=middleware)
  web = WebService(middleware=middleware)
        </div>
      </div>
