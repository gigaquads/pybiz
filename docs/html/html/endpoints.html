          <!-- <p>Endpoints define the
          interface with the outside world. Many different kinds of frameworks
          and platforms have the notion of endpoints, although they may go by
          different names. In command-line applications, endpoints are called
          <i>commands</i>; in GUI toolkits, they are often called <i>event
          callbacks</i>; and in web apps, they are called <i>routes</i>.</p> -->

          <p>
            Endpoints are the building blocks of APIs. Different frameworks
            have different terms for what is essentailly the same thing. Web
            frameworks call them endpoints or routes; command-line applications call them
            commands; and frontend frameworks call them callbacks. As a
            meta-framework, Pybiz abstracts these differences out.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Pybiz, each endpoint an arbitrary python function, consisting entirely of business logic, making no reference to things like requests and
            responses. The Pybiz application layer takes care of transforming native
            inputs into the arguments expected by the endpoint and the return
            value into the native response.
            Here is an example of an endpoint that is simultaneously reachable as a <a href="">gRPC</a> method, an HTTP route, and a REPL function:
          </p>

          <pre class="prettyprint">
@repl()
@grpc()
@http(method='GET', route='/accounts/{account}/settings')
def get_account_settings(account: Account) -> AccountSettings:
  return account.settings
          </pre>

          <h2>Endpoint Execution</h2>
          <p>When running endpoints, Pybiz executes a series of callbacks that apply
          middleware and transform native application inputs and outputs into and out
          of the endpoint. In the following documentation (as well as in code),
          the Python callable registered as an endpoint is called the <i>target</i>.

          </p>

          <h3>Process Overview:</h3>
          <ol id="steps-overview-list">
            <li><h4><code>Middleware.pre_execute</code></h4><p>Performing services as soon as the application receives a request.</p></li>
            <li><h4><code>Application.on_request</code></h4><p>Transforming native inputs into the positional and keyword arguments expected by the target.<p></li>
            <li><h4><code>Middleware.on_execute</code></h4><p>Performing
            services after the native inputs have been transformed but before the
            target executes.</p></li>
            <li><h4><code>Endpoint.target</code></h4><p>Calling the function registered as an endpoint with the arguments prepared by the application.</p></li>
            <li><h4><code>Application.on_response</code></h4><p>Transforming the target's return value into the native response expected by the application.</p></li>
            <li><h4><code>Middleware.post_request</code> or <code>post_bad_request</code></h4><p>Performing services after the final response has been generated or an error has occured.</p></li>

          <h2>Polymorphic Arguments</h2>
          <p>
          Most endpoints begin with a preamble of boilerplate queries intended
          to load objects referenced by the arguments. Imagine, if you will, an
          endpoint that adds a task to a project, which takes as arguments the
          ID of the user who owns the project, the ID of the project, and a data
          structure representing the new task:
          </p>

          <pre class="prettyprint">
@app()
def add_task(owner_id: str, project_id: str, task_data: dict):
    """
    Add a task to a project.
    """
    owner = User.get(owner_id)
    project = Project.get(list_id)
    task = Task(task_data)
    if owner.owns(project):
        project.append(task)
    return item
          </pre>

          <p>
          The aforementioned preamble of boilerplate queries has several
          dnativebacks.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>It's tedious.</li>
            <li>It's unrelated to what the endpoint says it does.
            <li>The referenced <code>Resource</code> instances are not available in middleware.</li>
            <li>The call pattern is too rigid and low-level.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
          With these considerations, Pybiz implements a form of <a href="">argument
          polymorphism</a>, in which IDs or dicts are accepted as valid
          arguments but resolved and normalized to corresponding
          <code>Resource</code> objects, either by loading them through the
          <a href="">DAL</a> or creating new instances. We can now simplify the endpoint above, yielding:
          </p>

          <pre class="prettyprint">
@app()
def add_task(owner: User, project: Project, task: Task) -> Task:
    """
    Add a task to a project.
    """
    if owner.owns(project):
        project.append(task)
    return task
          </pre>

          <p>
           Now, the semantics of endpoint more clearly reflect what its name says it does. On a side note, we could further simplify this endpoint using <a href="guarded-endpoints.html">guards</a> to perform authorization
          checks.
          </p>

          <h3>Enabling Polymorphism</h3>
          <p>
          Polymorphism is enabled by default on any argument annotated
          with <code>Resource</code> or <code>List[Resource]</code> (like <code>owner</code> and <code>project</code> above). The convenience of
          this approach becomes apparent when you try to reuse endpoints
          in different contexts. In web apps, for instance, you might want to
          call an endpoint using IDs in the URL, but in a REPL, you might want
          to pass the objects directly. In Pybiz, all of the following call patterns work:
          </p>

          <h4>Passing IDs as Arguments</h4>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-python">
add_item_to_todo_list(owner_id, todo_list_id, item_data)
          </pre>

          <h4>Passing Dicts as Arguments</h4>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-python">
add_item_to_todo_list({'_id': 'abc123'}, {'_id': 'xyz123'}, item_data)
          </pre>

          <h4>Passing Resources as Arguments</h4>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-python">
add_item_to_todo_list(owner, todo_list, item)
          </pre>
        </div>
      </div>
    </a>

    <a class="card-anchor" name="guards">
      <div class="card">
        <div>
          <h2>Endpoint Guards</h2>
          <p>
            According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(computer_science)">Wikipedia</a>,
            a <i>guard</i> is a boolean expression that must evaluate to true if the
            program execution is to continue. In Pybiz, you can use guards to
            check if preconditions are met before executing a requested endpoint.
          </p>

          <p>Using guards has several key advantages over performing similar
          logic directly inside endpoints:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Guards make it easier to identify why requests fail.</li>
            <li>They are modular, reusable, composable, and easy to test.</li>
            <li>They keep endpoint logic clean and pure.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Creating and using guards is easy. To do so, you implement two
            abstract methods in your <code>Guard</code> subclass:
          </p>
          <pre class="prettyprint">
@property
def description(self) -> str:
    """
    Generates and returns a textual description of what this instance does.
    """

def execute(self, context: dict, *args, **kwargs) -> bool:
    """
    Implements the check performed by the guard, raising an exception
    if the guard fails.
    """
          </pre>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Example with Two Guards</h3>
          <h4>The <i>Exists</i> Guard</h4>
          <p>
            This Exists guard ensures that an argument, specified by name, exists in the
            database. We pass the name of the argument to the guard's constructor.
          </p>
          <pre class="prettyprint">
class Exists(Guard):
    def __init__(self, arg: str):
        super().__init__()
        self.arg = arg

    @property
    def description(self):
        return f'{self.arg} exists'

    def execute(self, context, **kwargs):
        """
        Get the object from kwargs and ensure it exists in the DAL.
        """
        resource = kwargs.get(self.arg)
        if not ((resource is not None) and resource.exists()):
            raise self.fail(f'{self.arg} does not exist')
          </pre>

          <h4>The <i>Matches</i> Guard</h4>
          <p>
            The Matches guard ensures that the instance attributes of an endpoint
            argument match expected values.
          </p>
          <pre class="prettyprint">
class Matches(Guard):
    def __init__(self, arg: str, **expected: dict):
        super().__init__()
        self.arg = arg
        self.expected = expected

    @property
    def description(self):
        return ', '.join(
            f'{self.arg}.{field_name} is {expected_value}'
            for field_name, expected_value in self.expected.items()
        )

    def execute(self, context, **kwargs):
        """
        Get the object from kwargs and ensure that its instance attributes
        match expected values.
        """
        resource = kwargs.get(self.arg)
        for field_name, expected_value in self.expected.items():
            actual_value = resource[field_name]
            if actual_value != expected_value:
                raise self.fail(
                    f'{self.arg}.{field_name} expected to have a '
                    f'value of {expected_value} but got {actual_value}'
                )
          </pre>

          <h3>Applying Guards to an Endpoint</h3>
          <p>
          Now that we have our guards, let's define an endpoint, which
          simply returns a hypothetical User object.
        </p>
          <pre class="prettyprint">
@app()
def get_user(user: User) -> User:
    return user
          </pre>

          <p>
          Finally, we apply the guards. In this example, our guards will ensure two
          things. First, they ensure that the requested <code>user</code> object exists in the DAL.
          Second it will ensure that it's <code>visibility</code>
          attribute has a value of <code>"public"</code>.</p>

          <pre class="prettyprint">
  @app(guard=Exists('user') & Matches('user', visibility='public'))
  def get_user(user: User) -> User:
      return user
          </pre>
          <h3>Expected Error Log Output</h3>
          <p>
            Suppose we requested a user through this endpoint whose visibility
            was set to private rather than public. In the error logs, we'd see
            the following message:
           </p>

            <pre class="prettyprint">
01/14/2020 05:40:10 (E) ravel - error/s occured in endpoint "get_user"

    {
      "exception": "GuardFailure",
      "guard": {
        "class": "Matches",
        "description": "(user exists AND user.visibility is public)",
        "failed": "user.visibility is public"
      },
      "message": "user.visibility expected to have a value of public but got private",

    }
